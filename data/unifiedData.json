Osteolysis in Modular Knee Implants: His work studied the prevalence and implications of osteolysis in primary modular Freeman Samuelson total knee replacements. Preoperative Templating in Total Knee Replacement: Investigated the effectiveness of preoperative planning and templating on outcomes in TKR patients. Arthroscopic Techniques in Sports Injuries: Conducted research and case studies on arthroscopic surgical approaches for managing soft tissue injuries and chronic conditions like shoulder instability. Innovations in External Fixation: Studied the role and efficacy of external fixators in intra-articular distal radius fractures, including prospective trials and long-term outcomes. Joint Preservation and Partial Knee Replacement: He contributed research on the Oxford Partial Knee Replacement and minimally invasive surgery for joint preservation. Rare Orthopaedic Cases: Authored case reports on rare orthopaedic conditions such as recurrent osteoid osteoma and transulnar dislocations. His research was recognized during his clinical fellowship in the UK and he has been actively involved in mentoring and training orthopaedic surgeons through his research findings and clinical experience.",
