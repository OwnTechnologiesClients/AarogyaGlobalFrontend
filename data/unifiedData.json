His research work spans both clinical and surgical domains, focusing on: Computer-Navigated and Robotic-Assisted Knee Replacement: Dr. Arora has been a pioneer in integrating advanced technologies in knee surgeries, including patient-specific implants and computer navigation systems. Osteolysis in Modular Knee Implants: His work studied the prevalence and implications of osteolysis in primary modular Freeman Samuelson total knee replacements. Preoperative Templating in Total Knee Replacement: Investigated the effectiveness of preoperative planning and templating on outcomes in TKR patients. Arthroscopic Techniques in Sports Injuries: Conducted research and case studies on arthroscopic surgical approaches for managing soft tissue injuries and chronic conditions like shoulder instability. Innovations in External Fixation: Studied the role and efficacy of external fixators in intra-articular distal radius fractures, including prospective trials and long-term outcomes. Joint Preservation and Partial Knee Replacement: He contributed research on the Oxford Partial Knee Replacement and minimally invasive surgery for joint preservation. Rare Orthopaedic Cases: Authored case reports on rare orthopaedic conditions such as recurrent osteoid osteoma and transulnar dislocations. His research was recognized during his clinical fellowship in the UK and he has been actively involved in mentoring and training orthopaedic surgeons through his research findings and clinical experience.",

Minimally Invasive Surgery: He has studied the impact of computer navigation and robotic-assisted joint replacements on patient outcomes, precision in implant placement, and faster recovery times. Bone Banking: He was part of the team that helped establish India's first bone bank based on international tissue preservation standards—critical for cases needing bone grafts during joint or trauma surgery. Implant Design & Instrumentation: He holds a USFDA-approved patent for a femoral component extraction instrument used in revision knee replacement surgeries. Postoperative Recovery Protocols: His work also explores protocols that reduce hospital stay and improve post-surgical mobility in elderly patients.",
