    "question": "What is medical tourism, and why do patients travel abroad for treatment?",
    "answer": "Medical tourism means traveling to another country to get treatment. Patients choose this when healthcare is too expensive, unavailable, or delayed in their home country. For example, a heart bypass that costs $120,000 in the US may cost only $7,000–10,000 in India."
